#### Background 

<!-- </span> -->

My parents moved to the US from Iran for graduate school. I was born in Mountain View, California and moved to Eugene, Oregon when I was 2 months old and lived there my most o*f my life until college. Now I am beginning my third year at UCSD studing and I am hoping to join the Persian Student Association  <a href="https://www.iranianstudentsca.org/iranian-student-organizations">(PASA)</a> <!-- external link --> on campus this year to feel closer to home! 

#### Hobbies 

- My interests have always been in performing arts since before I can remember. In the realm of music and arts, my most consistent hobbies have been singing and dancing. I was in multiple competition groups high school. Now I continue with my passion in music through pursuing a cappella group UCSD. I am in a group called the <a href="https://www.tritones.ucsd.edu">Tritones</a> <!-- external link --> and this year I am the performance director. I look forward to competing at ICCA competitions either this year or next year!
- Another interest of mine is traveling! I have traveled with my family a lot, from roadtriping across Oregon to see waterfalls to going to Majorca for the beaches. I am so grateful to have been able to experience these places with my family, and hope to continue this passtime in the future as well.
		
#### Programming

<!-- unordered list -->
- I have been passionate about math since elementary school, so I entered my first year in college as an applied math major 
- During my first quarter I took a CS course and which sparked my interest in the field. As I  explored CS further in college, I switched my major to Math/Computer to take more programming classes.
- Currently, the applications I have explored in the CS-related fields have been in Bioinformatics. I have done two research projects in this field: 
	<!-- ordered list -->
    1. finding a gene signature to better identify tuberculosis in patients using Boolean analysis 
    2. metabolic pathway analysis: using graph neural networks to model metabolic data and find pathways for unannotated genes and compounds 
- Now I have grown to really enjoy programming and want to explore more applications of CS including SWE. I am excited to take CSE 110 this quarter to gain more experience and learn more about what it means to be a software engineer.
