		<p> My family is Persian. My parents moved to the US from Iran for graduate school. I was born in Mountain View, California and moved to Eugene, Oregon when I was 2 months old and lived there my most of my life until college. Now I am beginning my third year at UCSD studing and I am hoping to join the Persian Student Association  <a href="https://www.iranianstudentsca.org/iranian-student-organizations">(PASA)</a> <!-- external link --> on campus this year to feel closer to home!
	<span style="color:CornflowerBlue"> <h5> Hobbies </h5> </span>
		<ul><li> My interests have always been in performing arts since before I can remember. In the realm of music and arts, my most consistent hobbies have been singing and dancing. I was in multiple competition groups high school. Now I continue with my passion in music through pursuing a cappella group UCSD. I am in a group called the <a href="https://www.tritones.ucsd.edu">Tritones</a> <!-- external link --> and this year I am the performance director. I look forward to competing at ICCA competitions either this year or next year! </li>
		<li> Another interest of mine is traveling! I have traveled with my family a lot, from roadtriping across Oregon to see waterfalls to going to Majorca for the beaches. I am so grateful to have been able to experience these places with my family, and hope to continue this passtime in the future as well. </li>

	<!-- unordered list -->
		<ul><li> I have been passionate about math since elementary school, so I entered my first year in college as an applied math major </li>
  			<li> During my first quarter I took a CS course and which sparked my interest in the field. As I  explored CS further in college, I switched my major to Math/Computer to take more programming classes.</li>
			<li> Currently, the applications I have explored in the CS-related fields have been in Bioinformatics. I have done two research projects in this field:
			<!-- ordered list -->
				<ol>
					<li> finding a gene signature to better identify tuberculosis in patients using Boolean analysis </li>
					<li> metabolic pathway analysis: using graph neural networks to model metabolic data and find pathways for unannotated genes and compounds </li>
   				</ol>  
  			<li> Now I have grown to really enjoy programming and want to explore more applications of CS including SWE. I am excited to take CSE 110 this quarter to gain more experience and learn more about what it means to be a software engineer.</li></ul>
